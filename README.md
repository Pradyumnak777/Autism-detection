# Autism Detection (in subjects under 13 years of age) Using T1-Weighted sMRI Scans

This project utilizes T1-weighted structural MRI (sMRI) scans from the ABIDE-1 dataset to detect Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children under 13 years of age. A hybrid segmentation technique combining Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) was applied to the middle slice of the scans, followed by classification. The model achieved an accuracy of **94.29%** in distinguishing Autism from Control groups.

## Key Highlights

- **Dataset**: ABIDE-1 (T1-weighted sMRI scans)
- **Segmentation**: FCM-GMM hybrid on the middle slice
- **Accuracy**: 94.29% for subjects under 13 years
